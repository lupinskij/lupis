== Description ==

NOTE:  The earliest version of Gravity Forms this plugin has been tested with is v1.6.3 and the latest is v1.6.12.



This plugin allows Gravity Forms users to import entries from a CSV file



A new item will appear in you gravity forms side menu called "Import Entries".  There you will be provided with a selection box to pick which form you would like to import into.  Once selected, you will be provided with the "Labels" of your form that will be needed as the headers of your CSV file.  Make sure that you use those exactly.  If you have erroneous or unavailable headers in your CSV file, an error will be generated.  Please note, that this plugin is not designed to work with the gravity forms post fields or pricing/product fields.



This plugin was created for users who wish to use Gravity Forms as an online database/data entry option and wish to import data from a previous system.
